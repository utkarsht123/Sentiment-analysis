This project involved building an SMS spam detection model using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The project used the SMS Spam Collection dataset from UCI, where I implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for text classification.

The key steps included:

1. Data Preprocessing: Tokenized and cleaned the SMS messages using spaCy, removing stop words and punctuation.
2. Word Embeddings: Leveraged pre-trained GloVe embeddings to represent the tokenized text.
3. Model Architecture: Developed an RNN model using PyTorch with multiple hidden layers to classify messages as spam or ham.
4. Training: Trained the model using the Adam optimizer and evaluated its performance based on accuracy.
5. Deployment: Saved the trained model for deployment in a production environment.

This project showcased the application of NLP techniques and deep learning for text classification, highlighting the importance of preprocessing and embedding in model performance.
